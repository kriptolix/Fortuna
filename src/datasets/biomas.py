### **Equatorial Climate**
- **No distinct seasons:**  
  Weather conditions remain almost constant throughout the year. Average temperatures range from 25°C to 28°C, with high humidity (above 85%) and frequent rainfall. Precipitation is evenly distributed, varying between 2000 mm and 3000 mm annually.

---

### **Tropical Climate**
- **Rainy Season:**  
  Characterized by average temperatures of 25°C to 30°C, high humidity (above 80%), and intense rainfall, often exceeding 2000 mm. Thunderstorms may occur.  

- **Dry Season:**  
  Defined by minimal rainfall (less than 100 mm), lower humidity (50%-60%), and clear skies. Temperatures range from 24°C to 30°C.

---

### **Arid Climate**
- **No well-defined seasons:**  
  Little to no precipitation throughout the year (less than 250 mm). Temperatures may exceed 40°C during the day in summer, while dropping significantly at night. Low humidity (below 30%) is a constant feature.

---

### **Semi-Arid Climate**
- **Rainy Season:**  
  Brief, with scattered rains (250 mm to 500 mm annually), high evaporation, and average temperatures between 25°C and 35°C.  

- **Dry Season:**  
  Dominates most of the year, with high daytime temperatures (30°C to 40°C) and cooler nights. Humidity is low, and the soil remains predominantly dry.

---

### **Mediterranean Climate**
- **Winter:**  
  Moderate rainfall (300 mm to 600 mm annually), temperatures between 10°C and 15°C, and higher humidity.  

- **Summer:**  
  Hot and dry, with temperatures ranging from 25°C to 35°C, low humidity, and almost no precipitation.

---

### **Temperate Climate**
- **Spring:**  
  Mild temperatures (10°C to 20°C), light rainfall, and active plant growth.  

- **Summer:**  
  Warm, with temperatures between 20°C and 30°C, high humidity, and the possibility of quick and intense showers.  

- **Autumn:**  
  Gradually cooling temperatures (10°C to 20°C), fewer rainfalls, and falling leaves.  

- **Winter:**  
  Cold, with negative temperatures in some regions (-5°C to 10°C), potential snowfall, and low precipitation.

---

### **Humid Subtropical Climate**
